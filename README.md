The changes made are as follows.  The LME49740, which is not available anymore, has been replaced with two LM4562 op amps.  22 pF Miller capacitors are placed to stabilize the LM4562 from oscillation.  The signal grounds for the two channels are isolated from the power ground by hum breaker resistors.

This is a two-channel PCB layout for the LM3886-based Super Gain Clone by Bob Cordell.  It can be found in Chapter 27 in his book "Audio Amplifiers."
